# Bluetooth Low Energy in Android Java

## Chapter 10: Streaming Data


These are **complete downloadable code examples** from my book, _Bluetooth Low Energy with Android Java_.  The book teaches how to make Bluetooth Low Energy devices using iOS/Swift.  

This chapter teaches:
* Central: Use Notifications to know when to send packets of data to a connected Peripheral
* Peripheral: Use Notifications to alert a connected Central when the hosted Characteristic is ready for more data
